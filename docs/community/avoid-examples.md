# Examples to Avoid
These passages are examples of the type of communication which is likely to be problematic. Context is key, and in the context of a communication which clearly transmits an ethical core message, a passing mention of money probably does not make the whole communication unethical. But if the core message is not communicated with adequate clarity, then even the slightest mention of topics like the following may make the communication unethical.

* "Reaping the rewards for something you put zero effort in."
* "Easy money.‚Äù
* "So many people trust cryptocurrency as an investment."

While some of these statements may be factual, they share a common narrative that there is an opportunity, it is easy, and it leads to making money. This is a stark contrast from the Principle of No Expected Return.
