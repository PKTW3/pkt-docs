# Better Examples

Honest communications addressing topics like the following are more likely to be ethical.

* "Price has been on the rise, but this can be affected by market events outside the project."
* "We all know internet is over-priced, but now there is a community of people trying to do something about it"
* "I know cryptocurrencies are risky, and tomorrow it could all be worth nothing, but I'm spending money I can afford to lose on a something I believe in""
* "The control that big telecoms have over our everyday lives can make people feel powerless, but now thereâ€™s an easy way to push back"
* "Sometimes the price goes up and sometimes it goes down. Being part of the community is about believing that democratized internet and a decentralized media network is possible."
