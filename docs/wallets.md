# Wallets

The Base blockchain is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution that employs advanced wallet technology to enhance user experience. Wallets on the Base blockchain deliver great user interface, interaction with smart contracts, and low transaction fees with faster processing times.

The two recommended wallets are:

__MetaMask__: MetaMask is one of the most popular wallets for interacting with Ethereum and Ethereum-based layer-2 networks including Base. It is widely recognized for its ease of use and robust security features. It functions as a browser extension and a mobile app, providing users with a secure way to manage their identities on different sites and sign blockchain transactions. Given its integration capabilities with Base, MetaMask allows users to easily switch between the Ethereum mainnet and the Base network, making it a versatile tool for both new and experienced users.

__Coinbase Wallet__: Another excellent option for Base users is the Coinbase Wallet. It offers a user-friendly interface that supports not only cryptocurrency transactions but also interactions with dApps directly. This makes it ideal for those who prefer an all-in-one solution for managing their digital assets and engaging with the blockchain ecosystem.

Both wallets provide key functionalities needed for operating on the Base network, including secure storage of assets, easy access to dApps, and support for Ethereumâ€™s ERC-20 tokens and NFTs, including PKT on Base.
