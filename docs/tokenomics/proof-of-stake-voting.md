# Proof-of-Stake Voting

The Network Steward is determined using the Electorium voting system. At the time of staking, simply enter in a candidate wallet address to vote for Network Steward. Voting is tallied with staked tokens only (see [Governance](/governance)). 

Every Wednesday at 9am PST the candidate who is elected Network Steward will be announced in the PKT Discord.
