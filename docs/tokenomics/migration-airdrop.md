# Migration Airdrop

All PacketCrypt proof-of-work mined coin supply (“PoW”) holders are eligible to migrate their coins to PKT on Base. Eligible migrated coins will be airdropped on a 1:1 basis, based on a snapshot taken on August 21, 2024 at 8am Pacific Daylight Time (“Snapshot”).

One third (⅓) of each eligible PoW coin holder’s wallet balance will be redeemable in a 3 phase migration airdrop. In Phase-1, PoW holders will receive 100% of PoW coins that were on deposit on BitMart and MEXC centralized exchanges at the time of the Snapshot. Coins held on an exchange will be swapped 1:1. For anyone that has coins on the exchange that wants to swap PKT on Base back into their PoW coins can fill out this [form](https://pkt.cash/inquiry/){:target="_blank"} to follow the process to do this.

1.53B tokens will be eligible for migration in Phase-1 upon Launch. 1.53B tokens will be distributed in Phase-2, 6 months after Phase-1. 1.53B tokens will be distributed in Phase-3, 6 months after Phase-2.
