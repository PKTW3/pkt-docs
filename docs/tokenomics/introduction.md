# Tokenomics

!!! tldr "PKT has one token that powers both its governance and utility:"
    PKT is an ERC-20 utility token

PKT is yielded by staking using the dashboard on [https://pkt.cash](https://pkt.cash/){:target="_blank"}

There are three (3) types of staking after August 21, 2024 (“Launch”):

## STANDARD STAKING YIELDS

Standard staking yields enable holders to Stake-to-Earn on their tokens. Each 1PKT is equal to 1 Yield Credit. The longer the lockup duration, the higher the yield multiplier on the underlying locked balance. For example if 1 million PKT is staked for 1 year, it will receive 1 million x 4 yield credits, equal to 4 million yield credits. Additional tokens can be added to previous lockups at any time. PKT can be staked into a lockbox with optional renewable terms. 

Standard Staking Yield Multipliers:

* PKT locked for 3 months receives 1.5x yield multiplier
* PKT locked for 6 months receives a 2x yield multiplier
* PKT locked for 12 months receives a 4x yield multiplier

Beginning on October 30, 2024 (“Infrastructure Day”) each stake must pair with an infrastructure node (see [Infrastructure](/infra/infrastructure)). PKT is also used for governance. Any holder who stakes PKT can vote their stake during lockup, in favor of a Network Steward of their choice.

## LP STAKING

PKT holders who stake the liquidity pool on Uniswap (“LPs”) earn AMM fees paid by the Liquidity Pool. During the first 365 days after Launch, LP’s can earn a pro rata share of a 1,000,000 PKT daily yield by staking LP tokens in a lockup of at least 1 week (“LP Staking”). LP Tokens that are staked into a lockup will receive staking yield multipliers, as listed above.

## AFFILIATE YIELDS

PKT is also earned as a yield bonus paid to affiliates. A yield bonus is earned when someone uses an affiliate code (see [Affiliate Rewards](/affiliate)).
